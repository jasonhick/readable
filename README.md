# React Nanodegree by Udacity
## Project 2: Readable

Readable is the second project in the [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
It emulates a basic blogging system where anonymous users can create, edit and delete posts.
Users can also comment on posts and edit or delete them.

The site uses React with Redux and React Router, and hopefully(!) follows the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1017/view).

This repository contains a basic Node back-end server in `/api-server` as well as a basic front-end server.

### Installation
- Clone this repository onto your computer
- Run `npm install` from the root directory of the app
- Run `npm start` to start both servers
- The site should automatically launch at (http://localhost:3000)


### Running a production build
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `server -s build` to start a basic server for the front-end
- Open your browser at the url in the console - usually http://localhost:5000
- A production Node server is located at https://reddit-clone-server-nzukgqqhyc.now.sh



This app requires `Node JS` and `NPM` to be installed. Visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for more information.
